# sentiment_analysis_using_NLP
This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze the sentiment of social media text and classify it as positive, neutral, or negative. The sentiment classification will be achieved using Logistic Regression, a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Project Scope & Methodology:
Data Collection:

Gather tweets or other social media text datasets related to a business or product.

Data Preprocessing:
Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation and special characters.
Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Feature Engineering:
Convert textual data into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.

Model Training & Evaluation:
Train a Logistic Regression model on labeled sentiment data.
Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction & Insights Generation:
Classify new social media text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
Provide valuable business insights for customer engagement and brand management.

Impact & Benefits:
Helps businesses understand customer opinions in real-time.
Aids in identifying customer complaints and improving service quality.
Supports data-driven decision-making for marketing and product strategies.
This sentiment analysis system will serve as a powerful tool for businesses to monitor and enhance customer satisfaction through social media insights.
